# Youtube-Trending-Video-Analysis
This is an academic project where I analysed the 2023 Youtube Trending video data for USA. This resulted in an interesting finding on cooking videos which I further broke down using Tableau.
To convey the findings to users this was made into a data driven story including all visualisations.
